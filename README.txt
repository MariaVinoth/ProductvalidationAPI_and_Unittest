1.The assignment is done in Python.
2.Main module is “Assignment1.py” which is the one needed to be run from command line(this module will call the other modules internally)
3.While running this main module, it is necessary to give the input file name after the module name(if not given, then it will take a default file “orders.xml” which I have provided in the a1 folder)
4.The unit testings are done for each modules(all modules that start with “test_” are unit test modules).
5.Please note that after running test modules, you will see the results like “Ran 1 test”,”Ran 2 tests”.  The numbers are the number of functions that have been tested and not the number of test cases. Please check inside the modules for the test cases.
6.The test modules are to be ran individually.
7.The test modules tests the functions/methods inside the actual modules.
8.All the test modules use Assertequals to check the actual output with the desired output.
9.The output from the Assigment1 module will be written to an xmlfile called “order_response.xml” which will be automatically created.
10.The files test1.xml,test2.xml,test3.xml,test4.xml are the input files for the test module "test_Assignment1.py".
11.Please ignore the .pyc files which are the compiled py files
